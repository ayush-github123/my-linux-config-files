# What is this Repository

This repository stores all my Linux configuration files for different applications, software, and required `.conf` files as a backup.

These configurations are either:

* Downloaded from the internet and then customized by me, or
* Fully created and customized by me.

# Why Store Config Files?

### Simple: BECAUSE I CAN'T WRITE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN

I have a habit of frequently switching Linux distributions — either to test them out or just for fun.
Storing these files saves a lot of time and effort when setting things up again.
