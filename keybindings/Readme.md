# Why I uploaded this ?

I love my keybindings and hence can't work without these keybinding as my muscle memory is not used to it.
Hence I am uploading this file for backup or to use it when on other distros.

# Where to paste this file

The "default.conf" file needs to be in this dir:
	```bash
	cd /.config/hypr/conf/keybindings/ #for hyprland wm ofc
	```
