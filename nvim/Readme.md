# What is this ?

This is the lua file of the nvim.
It has the customisation I made to nvim + the plugins I installed on it.


# Why I uploaded it ?

I uploaded it because i wanted to keep it backed up safely somewhere and updated too.
Hence, I uploaded it here so that if I lose it somehow locally, I can easily pull the backup lua config file.


# Important Note:

1. The file needs to be in the following dir:
	```bash
	/.config/
	```
2. Simply do:
	```bash
	cd .config
	git clone https://github.com/ayush-github123/my-linux-config-files.git
	```
3. This will clone all the projects so rest needed to be deleted carefully.
